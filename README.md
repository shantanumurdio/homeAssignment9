Dynamic Content Appender

The Dynamic Content Appender is a straightforward web application that allows users to add and display text dynamically on a webpage. This is achieved through a simple interface where users can input text and click a button to see their input appear as paragraphs below.

How It Works
An HTML file (index.html) sets up the basic structure of the app:

It includes an input field for users to enter text.
A button labeled "Add Text" triggers the addition of the entered text.
A container div holds these elements along with an area where the output will be displayed.
A JavaScript file (script.js) handles the dynamic behavior:

It retrieves the button, input field, and output container elements from the HTML.
When the "Add Text" button is clicked, the entered text is extracted from the input field.
If the entered text is not empty, a new paragraph element is created with the entered text as its content.
The paragraph element is then added to the output container, and the input field is cleared for the next input.
The CSS styles (style.css) ensure a visually appealing layout:

The app is centered both horizontally and vertically on the page.
The input field, button, and container have specific styling for a neat and user-friendly appearance.
